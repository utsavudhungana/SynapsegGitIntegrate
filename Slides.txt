### **Slide 1: Title Slide**  
**Title:** The Impact of GitHub Copilot in Code Porting  
**Subtitle:** From TypeScript to GoLang – A Case Study  

---

### **Slide 2: Introduction**  
- **Overview of the Project**  
  - Porting a TypeScript module to GoLang  
  - Original estimation: **5-6 weeks**  
  - Actual completion with GitHub Copilot: **2-3 weeks**  

---

### **Slide 3: Challenges Without Copilot**  
- Manual research for:  
  - **Documentation** of GoLang modules  
  - Syntax differences between TypeScript and GoLang  
- High time consumption in writing repetitive boilerplate code  
- Greater chances of human error in code translation  

---

### **Slide 4: How GitHub Copilot Helped**  
- **Accelerated Development**  
  - Suggested syntax and boilerplate for GoLang  
  - Translated TypeScript constructs with high accuracy  
- **Reduced Research Time**  
  - Instant suggestions for GoLang equivalents of TypeScript functions  
  - Access to relevant documentation snippets directly in the editor  
- **Improved Productivity**  
  - Focused on logic instead of repetitive coding tasks

### **Slide 5: Key Metrics**  
| **Metric**           | **Without Copilot** | **With Copilot**  |  
|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|  
| Estimated Duration    | 5-6 weeks           | 2-3 weeks         |  
| Research Time         | High                | Low               |  
| Manual Effort         | High                | Reduced by ~50%   |  
| Accuracy              | Moderate            | High              |

### **Slide 6: Copilot in Day-to-Day Scripting**  
- **Time Savings:** Automates repetitive tasks like formatting, boilerplate generation, and error correction  
- **Enhanced Learning:** Shows code snippets and solutions inline, acting as an assistant and educator  
- **Documentation Shortcut:** Reduces the need to manually search for module and library documentation  
- **Consistent Code Quality:** Ensures uniform standards across scripts  

---

### **Slide 7: Limitations of GitHub Copilot**  
- **Translation Errors:**  
  - Cannot translate all TypeScript constructs to GoLang perfectly  
  - May require manual fixes and corrections  
- **Use of Deprecated Code:**  
  - Sometimes suggests outdated or deprecated syntax  
- **Inconsistency:**  
  - Suggestions are not always consistent or repeatable for similar prompts  
- **Prompt Dependency:**  
  - Effectiveness depends on providing clear and precise prompts  
  - Vague or incorrect prompts can lead to inefficient suggestions  

---

### **Slide 8: Importance of Correct Prompts**  
- **Why Prompts Matter:**  
  - Accurate prompts help Copilot provide relevant suggestions  
  - Avoids unnecessary iterations and errors  
- **Tips for Effective Prompts:**  
  - Be specific about functionality and context  
  - Provide sample inputs and expected outputs where possible  
  - Highlight the language and frameworks explicitly  

---

### **Slide 9: Visual Example**  
- **Scenario:** TypeScript function being converted to GoLang  
- Before: Manual conversion, multiple steps  
- After: Copilot-assisted transformation in seconds (Add code snippets or screenshots here)  

---

### **Slide 10: Conclusion**  
- **GitHub Copilot’s Impact**  
  - Significant reduction in project duration  
  - Enhanced focus on critical logic  
  - Improved efficiency in cross-language porting tasks  
- **Limitations:**  
  - Cannot fully replace human oversight  
  - Requires careful prompt creation and review of results  
- **Broader Benefits:**  
  - A reliable tool for scripting, prototyping, and learning
